                        We designed an algorithm to detect memory leaks using GC Logs. <br />

                        Better than re-weighting accuracy.  "never leaks memory" would still be 50%, and that's a rubbish algorithm.

                    <aside class="notes">
                       Bias: <br />
                          The less data you have the easier it is to fit, thus error will be low on the training set. <br />
                          However it will not generalise well so high error on validation set. <br />
                          The more data you get the harder it is to fit the training set thus error on training set increases. <br />
                          However the increased number of samples does help fit the validation set (but poorly) <br />
                          Eventualy cv error ~= training error
            
                       Variance: <br />
                          Fits training very well, adding more samples does not increase error much <br />
                          CV error is high, but does not reduce much hence they are far apart <br />

                    <aside class="notes">
                        RF can be tuned to over or under fit by setting the number of nodes in a decision tree. <br />
                        How do you choose that number? <br />
                        Similar approach to learning curves except insted of controlling number of samples restrict the algoriths ability to over fit. <br />
                        Gradualy increase the size of the trees. If they decrease together should not be over fitting. <br />
                        If they diverge then they can fit the training set but it does not generalise to the validation set...probably over fitting.

                        In our case validation error drops with training error <br />
                        Possible bias problem as error remains fairly high however 10% was acceptable for our purposes <br />
                        Improvement over 64 nodes is relatively small so we can save some clock cycles and limit tree sizes to 64. <br />
                        Validation data is also from a different source showing model generalises

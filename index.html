                        We designed an algorithm to detect memory leaks using GC Logs. <br />

                        Better than re-weighting accuracy.  "never leaks memory" would still be 50%, and that's a rubbish algorithm.

                       Bias:
                          The less data you have the easier it is to fit, thus error will be low on the training set.
                          However it will not generalise well so high error on validation set.
                          The more data you get the harder it is to fit the training set thus error on training set increases.
                          However the increased number of samples does help fit the validation set (but poorly)
                          Eventualy cv error ~= training error
            
                       Variance:
                          Fits training very well, adding more samples does not increase error much
                          CV error is high, but does not reduce much hence they are far apart

                        RF can be tuned to over or under fit by setting the number of nodes in a decision tree.
                        How do you choose that number?
                        Similar approach to learning curves except insted of controlling number of samples restrict the algoriths ability to over fit.
                        Gradualy increase the size of the trees. If they decrease together should not be over fitting.
                        If they diverge then they can fit the training set but it does not generalise to the validation set...probably over fitting.

                        In our case validation error drops with training error
                        Possible bias problem as error remains fairly high however 10% was acceptable for our purposes
                        Improvement over 64 nodes is relatively small so we can save some clock cycles and limit tree sizes to 64.
                        Validation data is also from a different source showing model generalises
